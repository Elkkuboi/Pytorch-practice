# PyTorch Exercises

This repository contains machine learning exercises I've completed while following the Daniel Bourkes 'Learn PyTorch for deep learning in a day. Literally.' guide.

## Goal
My goal is to learn the fundamentals of PyTorch and apply them through practical examples. This project covers topics such as linear regression, building neural networks, and training models.

## Projects
* **Linear Regression:** The first script, `linear_regression.py`, implements a simple linear regression model from scratch.
