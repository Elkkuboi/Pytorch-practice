# PyTorch Exercises

This repository contains machine learning exercises I've completed while following the Daniel Bourkes 'Learn PyTorch for deep learning in a day. Literally.' guide.

## Goal
My goal is to learn the fundamentals of PyTorch and apply them through practical examples. This project covers topics such as linear regression, building neural networks, and training models.

## Projects
* **Linear Regression:** The first script, `linear_regression.py`, implements a simple linear regression model from scratch.
* **Binary Classification:** The script `classification.py` implements a small end-to-end classification example in PyTorch.  
  It demonstrates creating a toy dataset, a lightweight feed-forward neural network, the complete training/validation loop, basic metrics (accuracy, loss).
* **Multiclassification with IRIS dataset** This script is a classic, the "hello world" of multiclassification ml. It's a compact, end-to-end example using the Iris dataset and a feed-forward network implemented with torch.nn.Sequential.
